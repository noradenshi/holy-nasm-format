## The Divine Formatting Principles

The Holy-NASM formatter follows the sacred laws of proper NASM assembly. These include:

- Indentation – Each instruction and label shall be aligned as the heavens intended.

- Label Alignment – Labels must be on their rightful lines, not scattered like fallen leaves.

- Whitespace Sanctity – Excessive whitespace is a sin. The formatter shall cleanse your code of these transgressions.

## Installation

Before embarking on this journey, you must prepare your system to accept this holy gift.
